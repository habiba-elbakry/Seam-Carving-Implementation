# Seam-Carving-Implementation
This is an python implementation to seam carving algorithm
the implementation is done on a python jupyter notebook 
I have done two trials  one with the algorithm it took about 1.5 hours to implement and the other took 17.87 seconds to resize the image  this implementation and this is the results 
the first algorithm you can see in the Lab1.ipynb file and the second implementation is the optimised.ipynb file
