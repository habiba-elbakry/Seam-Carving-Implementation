# Seam-Carving-Implementation
This is an python implementation to seam carving algorithm
the implementation is done on a python jupyter notebook 
--I have done two trials  one with the algorithm it took about 1.5 hours to implement and the other took 17.87 seconds to resize the image
--The image was resized verticaly with 30% scale *but it could be done in horizontal way too and up to 50% scale by prompt input *
--the first algorithm you can see in the Lab1.ipynb file and the second implementation is the optimised.ipynb file
